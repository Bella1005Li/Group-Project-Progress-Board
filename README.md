Group Project Progress Board

Overview

This visualisation of group participation and progress was made with Processing (Python Mode).  A bar represents each person, and the colour of the bar changes from red to yellow to green based on how far along they are.  Users may click on the bars to change the data, which makes it both interactive and expressive.

Features

1. Use `lerpColor()` to make the colour change from red to yellow to green.
2. `mousePressed()` events let you interact with things in real time.
3. Showing how well each person and the group is doing.
4. The average progress is updated automatically.

How to Run

1. Start Processing and open the project.
2. Change to Python Mode.
3. To start the programme, click Run.
4. Click on a bar with the left mouse button to move forward, and click on it with the right mouse button to move back.

Reflection

This project taught me how to organise code, use iteration to handle various data objects, and make systems that people can interact with. Debugging helped me see how creative code uses logic and design to show how people work together.
